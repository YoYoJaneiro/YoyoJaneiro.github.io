During my second year of bachelorâ€™s degree in Game Programming, 
one of the modules we studied was about **optimization**. 
What tools we had to **measure**, **profile**, understand and in the end **optimize** our programs 
for them to be more efficient and use less energy to be run.

The **entire process** is explained in my blog post that you can find [HERE](https://sstyles93.github.io/blog/posts/RasterizerOptimization/) or with the button below
