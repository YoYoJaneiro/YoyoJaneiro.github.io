**Billy the Zombie** was a game I made for a **game design exam** at the **SAE-Institute**.
For that exam I had to **create** a [**GDD**](/pdf/GDD_BillyTheZombie.pdf) (Game Design Document),
a [**pitch**](/pdf/Pitch_BillyTheZombie.pdf) presentation and **program** the entire game from sratch.

During that module that lasted **one month**, I was able to **implement**:
- **A\* pathfinding** algorithm for three type of enemies
- **Binary Space Partitioning** algorithm
- An **Upgrade system** with four type of weapons
- A **Currency system**
- The **User input** and the corresponding **UI**
- A **Wave system** with gates opening according to the reached level
- An introduction **cinematic**
- A Start, pause and end **menu**
