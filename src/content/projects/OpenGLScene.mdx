import Button from "../../components/Button.astro";

This project was an [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) graphics engine created from scratch during a computer graphics module given at 
the [**SAE-Institute Geneva**](https://www.sae.edu/ch-ge/).

The elements I implemented were:
- Image Based Lighting (IBL)
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)
- ACES HDR Tone Mapping
- Deferred Rendering
- Bloom & Blur
- Shadow Maps
- Normal Mapping
- Model Loading (OBJ)

Unfortunately my **only regret** was to **not** have enough time to **refactor**, **clean** and do good **abstractions** with my code.

## What I learned
<ul class="list-disc mx-6">
<li>The [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) API</li>
<li>[GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)</li>
<li>The **importance** of **abstractions** !</li>
</ul>
