This project was made during my first year at the SAE-Institute. The purpose of this project was to use [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
for the rendering and **code** our own **2D physics engine**.

During the module I implemented:
- **Box** and **Sphere** colliders
- [AABB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box) Collisions
- **Broad** and **Narrow** collision resolution **phases**
- Binary Space Partitionning **(BSP)**
- SFML interactive UI
