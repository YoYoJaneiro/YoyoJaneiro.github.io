This project was made in **1 Week** at the **[SGA](https://gameacademy.ch/SGA/)** (Swiss Game Academy) in summer 2021.
Initially I was there to teach and help candidates but I ended up by being part of the team.

During the week I worked on multiple aspects of the game, from **User Input** and **Controler recognition** to **Gameplay mecanics** and **Graphical improvements**.

## What I learned
