This little game was a project I worked on for **one week** during my **first year** of **bachelor's degree**
to learn and integrate **procedural generation**.

The **goal** of the game is to **find** a **golden coin** that gives access to the **boss room** and **defeat** the **boss** inside.  
Every time the game is played, the **generation of rooms** is done and a different layout is created.

## What I learned

<li>Unity</li>

<li>PCG Algorithms</li>
