This game was made with **[Unity](https://unity.com/)** in **2 days** at the [SwissGameCenter](https://swissgamecenter.ch/lvlup.php?lang=fr)'s 
[**LvlUp**](https://lvlupgamejam.ch/) **GameJam** at 
[**Fribourg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fribourg) in **Switzerland**.
It was my first experience with Unity and during the game jam I discovered how to program a game from start to end 
and create simple visual effects using Unity's **[Shader Graph](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-graph.html)**
