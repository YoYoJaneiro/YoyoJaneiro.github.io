This simple spaceship game was my **first C++ game** made during a module of introduction to programming at the [**SAE-Institute Geneva**](https://www.sae.edu/ch-ge/).
At the end of the module we had to create a game **in a week** with what we had learned.  

**[SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)** was used for the rendering and **[Box2D](https://box2d.org/)** for the physics.

For this project I went **a step further** than what was asked for the module by 
integrating a **scoring system** that would keep track of the players last score locally.

## What I learned
<ul class="list-disc mx-6">
<li>Basic C++</li>
<li>SFML</li>
<li>Box2D</li>
</ul>
